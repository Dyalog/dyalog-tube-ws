*Source for building the dfns tube planner workspace (tube.dws)*

## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests for files in the [`sources`](sources) directory, both with corrections to already included cities, and with entirely new cities.

The format for simple routes should be fairly self-explanatory. [`notes/tube.txt`](notes/tube.txt) describes the exact format for the more complicated constructs; forks, crosses, and one-way sections, while [`notes/source.txt`](notes/source.txt) demonstrates their use in a minimal route network.

Contributions will be acknowledged at the bottom of [`notes/tube.txt`](notes/tube.txt).
